# Sort with me project

in this project, I have built a simple website designed  to teach new programmers the main sorting algorithms

## about the algorithms

each algorithms section is divided  into 3 parts, the first is a simple explanation  of the selected  algorithms with a nice gif 
to help better understand the main principle behind the algorithem.

in the second part, you will be able to see the code used in the code for the sorting.


### the heart of the project

the third  part is the algorithms itself , you will be able to see a randomly generated array and by pressing start you can see the specific
algorithms in action! this is not an animation or video, it's the real sorting happening in progress with a lot of promises and async functions 
meant to slow the process so the user will be able to understand better the way the algorithms work.

by using this visual presentation the user can understand better the complexity of the sorting and the pros and cons of it.


### the main difficulty 

the main difficulty was to use an async function in a recursion way  using react , the state change and the life cycle of the react did not allow me to time it easily, to top it, the fact the javascript is single-threaded rased a difficulty in re-renders in mid recursion
